# InferNET-ModelSelection
A simple model showing how model selection works using Bayes factor. Two models are competing at explaining the randomized trials data:
1. There is treatment effect
2. There is no treatment effect

The model works because the Bayesian approach automatically favors the least complicated model. One can reasonably argue that the "has effect" model can also explain the data that has been actually generated by the "no effect" data. The Bayesian approach automatically selects the correct least complicated model. If the models are faithful at describing the generative process, Bayes inference will correctly infer it.

This is a nice demo on why Bayesian methods do not overfit.
